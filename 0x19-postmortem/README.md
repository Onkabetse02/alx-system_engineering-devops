# Incident Report

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
The outage occurred from May 10, 2024, at 15:00 GMT to May 11, 2024, at 09:00 GMT.

**Impact:**  
The upgrade to the server software resulted in disrupted traffic flow and reduced monitoring capacity. Approximately 70% of users experienced slow response times and intermittent service disruptions.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the issue was identified as compatibility issues between the upgraded server software and existing network configurations.

## Timeline

- **May 10, 2024, 15:00 GMT:**  
  - **Detection:** Issue detected when monitoring alerts indicated increased server load and traffic disruptions.
  - **Actions Taken:** Investigation focused on network configurations and server logs. Initial assumptions suggested hardware failure or network congestion.
  - **Misleading Paths:** Initial investigation wrongly focused on hardware issues, leading to wasted time troubleshooting physical components.
  - **Escalation:** Incident escalated to the Network Operations Center (NOC) and System Administrators for further analysis and resolution.
- **Resolution:**  
  - The issue was resolved by reverting the server software upgrade and applying compatibility patches to restore normal operations.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the issue was compatibility issues between the upgraded server software and existing network configurations. Specifically, the new software version introduced changes that conflicted with network protocols, causing disruptions in traffic flow and monitoring capacity.

To resolve the issue, the server software upgrade was rolled back to the previous version, restoring compatibility with existing network configurations. Additionally, compatibility patches were applied to ensure seamless integration of future software updates with the network environment.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**
1. Conduct thorough compatibility testing before implementing server software upgrades.
2. Enhance monitoring capabilities to promptly detect and mitigate performance issues.
3. Implement a formal incident response plan to streamline troubleshooting and resolution processes.

**Tasks:**
1. Perform compatibility testing for all future server software upgrades.
2. Enhance monitoring systems to provide real-time visibility into server performance metrics.
3. Develop and document an incident response plan outlining escalation procedures and responsibilities for key stakeholders.
4. Conduct staff training on incident response protocols and best practices for troubleshooting and resolving server issues.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize the risk of future server disruptions and enhance the reliability and performance of our network infrastructure.
